# Java-Arcade-Game

## Introduction 

A Java application developed in IntelliJ IDEA during my second year of university. This project leverages the power of Java 8, particularly its Swing package, to create an interactive graphical application. Designed to run on a dedicated thread with 60 frames per second rendering, it employs thread waiting, a KeyHandler for user input, and an efficient update-redraw mechanism to provide a responsive and engaging user experience.

## Controls

- **A and D Keys**: Use the A key to move your character left along the horizontal axis, and use the D key to move your character right.

- **SPACE**: Press the SPACE key to fire a missile from your character. Use this to shoot down obstacles or enemies.

- **ESC Key**: Press the ESC key to pause the game. Press it again to continue playing.

These controls provide a simple and intuitive way to navigate through the game and interact with the environment.
